The dataset includes 142 images.
Laptop-tablet-tablet are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -19° to +19° horizontally and -20° to +20° vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 3.3 pixels
